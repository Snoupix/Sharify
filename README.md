# Sharify by Snoupix

Sharify is a Sveltekit web app (with a private API) project that resolves the following problem: let's say you're at a party and someone you don't know manages the music with **Spotify**. You would like to put a particular song but you can't control his/her phone. Here comes Sharify. It's an app where you link your Spotify account to create a "room" with a password where people can join and add a song to your current playlist queue. So everyone with the app and the room's password can add songs to listen to!

### EDIT

Spotify recently released [Spotify Jam](https://support.spotify.com/us/article/jam/) which is an equivalent of my app but since I wanted to add features for streamers like moderation stuff, a twitch bot, a Deezer/Youtube link.. This project will still be continued.

## Status

This project of mine is kinda old and went through a few rewrites.
From **Remix and React** to **Sveltekit** to **Sveltekit & a Private Server API to handle everything but routing**...
Today, I want to release that app because I think it's a waste to let it untouched but before that I want a *last* rewrite in **Svelte 5**.

So, until that Svelte 5 rewrite is done, this app is in WIP but the `svelte_rewrite` branch has a working state (my API is still private ATM, might become public one day).
